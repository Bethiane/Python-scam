# Python-scam

I'd like to first mention that the biggest problems I encountered during this homework was to give the victim an IP address in the same network with my local computer.
Currently, it is not working well because I still need to get my PC connected to internet via Ethernet. 

Anyway, my program is the first version of what I need to do as today it is only running in terminal; I don't have the user interface. Once the user runs the program in terminal, I have some threads that runs in background simultaneously with the interactions of the user.
